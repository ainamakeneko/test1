# Escape Game

This repository contains a simple text-based escape game in `escape_game.py`.

Run it with:

```bash
python3 escape_game.py
```

Follow the prompts to look around, take the key, and open the door to escape.

## Graphical UI

A basic Tkinter UI is also provided in `escape_game_ui.py`:

```bash
python3 escape_game_ui.py
```

Use the buttons to interact with the game.

## Novel Game

A command line novel viewer is available in `novel_game.py`. It reads `NOVEL_TAG.md` and
shows the story one line at a time. Run it with:

```bash
python3 novel_game.py
```

Press Enter after each line to advance through the narrative.
